- **Beast Master** - Character who communicates with and commands animals through supernatural connection. Speaks their language and convinces creatures to aid them willingly or through mental control.
- **Emotion Control** - Direct manipulation of others' emotional states without requiring magic or technology. Can intensify, dampen, or alter feelings in targets through force of will.
- **Hypnotic Eyes** - Gaze that compels others into hypnotic trance with eye contact. Looking into these eyes leaves victims mesmerized and susceptible to suggestions.
- **Mass Hypnosis** - Hypnotizing large groups or crowds simultaneously through broadcast or presence. One person taking mental control of many at once.
- **Mind Control** - Direct command over another's thoughts and actions causing total domination. Victim's consciousness becomes extension of controller's will with no resistance possible.
- **People Puppets** - Controlling someone's physical body like marionette on strings without touching them. Forcing victims to move and act against their will through direct physical manipulation.
- **Mind Reading** - Perceiving another person's thoughts as they form in real-time telepathically. Access to internal monologue and private mental content.
- **The Empath** - Sensing and understanding others' emotional states through supernatural perception alone. Feeling what others feel creates deep understanding of their mental state.

## Usage Notes

**Category Selection Guide:**
- **Extreme Combat**: Use for Endbringer fights, S-class encounters, desperate battles
- **Combat**: Use for normal cape fights, patrol encounters, street action
- **Social**: Use for any scene with other people present and interacting
- **Isolated**: Use for solo scenes, self-reflection, personal transformation
- **Companion**: Use when focusing on Taylor/companion or when companion is present/relevant
- **Fanservice**: Use for aesthetic appeal, dramatic presentation, or comedic situations
- **Wildcard**: Use when unsure, or when you want maximum unpredictability

**Master Component Warning**: Any trope that involves controlling others' minds, emotions, or bodies should NOT affect Danny directly per the power rules. These can still be used on other targets.

**Power Mechanics Reminder**:
- Each trope rolls 2d20 (Longevity and Intensity)
- Danny assigns each die result to either characteristic
- Natural 1 = Blind reroll (Danny doesn't know what changed)
- Natural 20 = Danny earns a Bonus Modifier (9 options to modify existing tropes)
- Each trope use reduces maximum roll by 25% for one hour

**Intensity Scale**: Low (1-5) = subtle; Medium (6-13) = noticeable; High (14-19) = dramatic
**Longevity Scale**: 18-19 = Permanent; 15-17 = weeks to months; 10-14 = days to weeks; 3-9 = minutes to hours

**Application Strategy**: Danny has seconds to decide where to apply each trope, or it defaults to affecting him directly. If no viable targets exist or the trope can't be applied in the current situation, it simply fails to manifest with no energy cost. Consider creative applications beyond the obvious!

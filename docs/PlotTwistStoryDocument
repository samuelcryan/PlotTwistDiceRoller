# Plot Twist
## A Worm AU Fanfiction - Danny Hebert as Protagonist

---

## Core Premise

Danny Hebert triggers with a Trump power that applies random tropes to his environment while sitting at his daughter's hospital bedside. Taylor is suffering from overwhelming sensory input from her newly-triggered bug control power, and Danny's helplessness as a fatherÃ¢â‚¬â€unable to protect her, understand her suffering, or even reach herÃ¢â‚¬â€breaks him. Now both father and daughter are capes, neither knowing about the other, as Danny tries to help his daughter while being pulled deeper into the cape world he never wanted to join.

---

## The Trigger Event

### **Taylor's Hospitalization**
**Timeline**: January 2011, shortly after the locker incident

**Taylor's Condition:**
- Hospitalized for infection and "extreme trauma response"
- Just triggered with bug control power
- Experiencing overwhelming sensory input from every bug in range
- Can't filter the information, can't turn it off
- Heavily sedated but still clearly in distress
- Thrashing, crying, incomprehensible muttering about "too many" and "everywhere"
- Doctors attribute it to PTSD and trauma, recommend psychiatric evaluation

### **Danny's Vigil**
**The Build-Up (Days 1-4):**
- Takes emergency leave from the Dockworkers to stay with Taylor
- Sits at her bedside constantly, holding her hand
- She won't tell him what happened (can't explain the locker, can't explain the bugs)
- Watches her suffer and can't help
- Realizes he never noticed the bullying
- Kurt and Lacey visit, try to get him to rest, but he won't leave

**The Breaking Point (Day 5):**
- Taylor has a particularly bad episode in the middle of the night
- Seizure-like thrashing, screaming about "insects everywhere"
- Nurses rush in, Danny is pushed aside
- He stands there watching, unable to do anything
- The realization hits him like a physical blow:

*He failed her. He didn't protect her. He didn't notice. And now she's breaking apart in front of him and he can't help her. He can't reach her. He can't fix this. He's her father and he's completely, utterly powerless.*

*If Annette were here, she'd know what to do. She could sit beside Taylor's bed and tell her a story—something to distract her, to comfort her, to reach her when nothing else could. But Annette is gone, and Danny doesn't know how to do any of those things. He can only sit here, holding Taylor's hand, useless.*

### **The Trigger**
**Classification**: Trump (Trope Application)

**Trigger Type**: Helplessness trigger - inability to help/protect someone he loves, compounded by his failure to notice her suffering earlier

**Shard Ping**: Danny's shard pinged off Dauntless, who was at the hospital at the same time (visiting family or on patrol). Dauntless' powerâ€”which grants temporary effects that slowly become permanent with repeated applicationâ€”provided the template for the Trump classification. The similarity in their powers (both apply effects with variable duration/intensity) explains the Trump aspect, though Danny's implementation is far more random and narrative-focused.

**First Manifestation:**
- Danny doesn't immediately notice
- A trope pulls while he's standing there frozen
- He has seconds to direct it or it defaults to him
- In his emotional state, he doesn't consciously direct it
- Something small happens (nurse becomes unusually kind, lighting becomes dramatic, Taylor's distress momentarily eases)
- He attributes it to coincidence, exhaustion, wishful thinking

**Initial Confusion:**
- Power continues pulling tropes over the next few hours
- Danny slowly realizes something is wrong/different
- Tries to make sense of the strange occurrences
- Eventually realizes: *he* is causing them
- Keeps it secret, doesn't want to burden Taylor or seem "crazy"

---

## Power Mechanics

### Basic Function
When a trope is selected, Danny experiences it as a sensation (a tingling, a pressure, a knowing) and has seconds to direct it at a target (person, object, area) or it defaults to affecting him directly.

**Master Immunity**: Any trope with a master component cannot affect Danny directly (protects his agency).

### The 2d20 System
Each trope application rolls **two D20s**. Danny can assign each die to either Longevity or Intensity, choosing which characteristic gets which roll.

**Special Roll Results:**
- **Natural 1**: Danny is unaware the trope was applied; triggers a blind reroll for that characteristic (he assigns the reroll without knowing what it will affect)
- **Natural 20**: When a 20 is rolled, the pulled trope is ignored and not presented. Instead, Danny earns a bonus modifier that can be applied to any existing active trope.
- **Reroll Rules**: When rerolling (from a 1), treat a rerolled 1 as 2 to prevent infinite chains. Natural 20s on rerolls are treated as 19.

### Bonus Modifiers (Natural 20 Results)
When Danny rolls a Natural 20, he receives one of the following modifiers instead of a trope:
- **+3 to a dice value**: Add 3 to any existing trope's Intensity or Longevity die (maximum 19)
- **-5 to a dice value**: Reduce any existing trope's Intensity or Longevity die by 5 (minimum 2)
- **Reroll dice**: Reroll either the Intensity or Longevity die of any active trope
- **Expire a trope**: Immediately end any active trope regardless of remaining duration
- **Swap two dice values**: Exchange the Intensity and Longevity values of any active trope
- **Make permanent**: Set any trope's Longevity value to 18 (permanent but degrading)
- **Change trope assignment**: Move a trope from its current target to a different valid target
- **+3 energy**: Immediately restore 3 charges (up to maximum capacity)
- **Refresh trope**: Reset any trope's duration timer to its original Longevity value

**Modifier Strategy**: Bonus Modifiers can be applied to past pulled tropes, not just recent ones. This allows Danny to enhance valuable tropes, mitigate problematic ones, or manage his active effect portfolio strategically.

### Longevity Scale
- 1 - Special (blind reroll)
- 2 - 12 seconds
- 3 - 36 seconds
- 4 - 90 seconds (~1.5 minutes)
- 5 - 3 minutes
- 6 - 6 minutes
- 7 - 12 minutes
- 8 - 24 minutes
- 9 - 45 minutes
- 10 - 1.5 hours
- 11 - 3 hours
- 12 - 6 hours
- 13 - 12 hours (ramp begins)
- 14 - 2 days
- 15 - 5 days
- 16 - 2 weeks
- 17 - 1 month
- 18 - Permanent* (degrades with use/time/energy expenditure until eventually expiring)
- 19 - Permanent (true, never expires)
- 20 - Special (grants Bonus Modifier)

### Intensity Scale
- 20 - Special (grants Bonus Modifier)
- 19 - Overwhelming, reality-warping change
- 18 - Extreme, dramatic change
- 17 - Very significant change
- 16 - Significant change  
- 15 - Notable change
- 14 - Considerable change
- 13 - Moderate-strong change
- 12 - Moderate change
- 11 - Noticeable change
- 10 - Noticeable but subtle change
- 9 - Mild change
- 8 - Minor change
- 7 - Slight change
- 6 - Very slight change
- 5 - Subtle change
- 4 - Very subtle change
- 3 - Barely noticeable change
- 2 - Extremely subtle change
- 1 - Special (blind reroll)

### Conflict Escalation
The power is sentient (as all shards are). During higher-stakes conflict (especially cape fights, gang confrontations, life-or-death situations), the shard pulls from trope pools more likely to be useful. Over time, as Danny engages in more conflict, the power becomes more aligned with his needsÃ¢â‚¬â€but this encourages him deeper into cape life.

### Trope Relevance
Tropes that don't fit Danny's current situation "feel like sand through the fingers" and cannot be applied. This prevents completely nonsensical applications but allows creative uses.

### Trope Application Failure
When a trope is pulled but cannot be applied, it simply fails to manifest:

**Failure Conditions:**
- No valid target exists (trope requires specific target type that isn't present)
- No target in line of sight or close proximity (roughly within 30 feet)
- Situation doesn't match trope requirements (narrative mismatch)
- Trope has Master component and would only affect Danny (Master immunity)

**Failure Consequences:**
- Trope fails to manifestâ€”the pull is "wasted"
- **Full charge refund**—failed applications return the full 1 charge cost
- Danny receives immediate feedback that the trope won't work
- **10-second recovery time** before power is available again

**Strategic Implications:**
- Encourages experimental power useâ€”trying things has no cost if they don't work
- Reduces frustrationâ€”no penalty for the power offering unusable options
- Banking system allows tactical reserves but locks capacity
- Slow regeneration encourages careful resource management

## Character Profile: Danny Hebert

### Background
**Age**: 38-40
**Occupation**: Hiring Manager for the Dockworkers Association
**Family**: Widower (Annette died 2008), father to Taylor (15)
**Residence**: Brockton Bay, near the Docks

**Pre-Trigger Characterization:**
- Devoted but emotionally distant father
- Still grieving Annette after 3 years
- Dedicated to the union and dockworkers
- Well-meaning but often ineffective at connecting with Taylor
- Buried himself in work instead of processing grief
- Didn't notice Taylor's isolation and bullying

### Post-Trigger Changes

**Immediate Effects:**
- More vigilant and protective of Taylor (overcompensating for his failure)
- Determined to be a better father
- Reluctantly drawn into cape affairs
- Uses powers initially just to help, not for heroism

**Power-Driven Evolution:**
- Conflict escalation mechanic rewards helping people (which creates conflict)
- Union disputes become more dangerous as he intervenes
- Gang pressure on docks forces cape confrontations
- The better father he tries to be, the more powerful he becomes
- Eventually can't avoid cape identity

**Internal Conflict:**
- Never wanted to be a cape
- Sees powers as another way he's failing to be "normal" for Taylor
- Guilt over keeping secrets from her
- Fear that cape life will take him away from her (like it did Annette's attention)
- Struggles with the utilitarian calculus: should he use powers if they help people?
- **Grief over Annette**: When he realizes his power is all about narrative devices—tropes, stories, literary mechanics—he grieves for her all over again. Annette was an English professor; she loved stories, understood narrative structure. His power is a constant reminder of what he lost. Eventually, he takes solace in this: his power becomes a way to never forget her, to carry forward her love of stories.
- **Master Paranoia**: Sorely tempted to use his power in union negotiations (one helpful trope could secure better conditions for dozens of families). But Canary's trial is all over the news—Masters are feared, prosecuted, their agency stripped away. He becomes paranoid about discovery.
- **Master Realization**: He IS a Master, or at least has Master components. His power pulls from Master trope pools he can't control. Any pull could force someone to act out-of-character, and he wouldn't know until it manifests. This terrifies him—he could accidentally Master someone during a negotiation and never know if their agreement was genuine.

### Relationships

**Taylor Hebert:**
- Doesn't know she has powers
- Trying desperately to reconnect with her
- Overcompensating for his previous emotional distance
- Terrified of losing her like he lost Annette
- Every conversation mined for information about her recovery
- Doesn't realize she's also keeping cape secrets

**Kurt and Lacey (Dockworkers):**
- His closest friends and confidants
- They notice he's changed after Taylor's hospitalization
- Might eventually learn about his powers
- Provide grounding and civilian perspective
- Help cover for him when cape duties interfere

**The Dockworkers Association:**
- He has responsibility to ~50 families
- Gang pressure affects their livelihoods
- They trust him to negotiate and protect their interests
- His power use starts affecting them (better contracts, safer conditions, but also more gang attention)
- Can't abandon them even when cape life gets dangerous

## Key Themes

### **Helplessness vs. Power**
- Danny triggered from complete helplessness
- Now has reality-warping powers
- Still often feels helpless (can't control Taylor's choices, can't fix everything)
- Power doesn't solve emotional problems

### **Protection and Secrets**
- Both keeping secrets to "protect" each other
- Secrets create distance and danger
- True protection comes from trust and honesty
- Parallel to canon Taylor's tendency to keep secrets

### **Unintended Consequences**
- Danny's helpful actions create conflict
- Conflict makes him stronger
- Being stronger encourages more intervention
- Positive feedback loop pulls him deeper into cape world
- Good intentions Ã¢â€°Â  good outcomes

### **Identity and Duty**
- Danny as father vs. Danny as cape
- Obligations to family vs. obligations to community
- Can he be both? Must he choose?
- How much of himself does he lose to the cape identity?

### **Generational Trauma**
- Danny lost Annette, became distant from Taylor
- Taylor lost her mother, was bullied, became isolated
- Both triggered from trauma
- Both trying to protect each other from more trauma
- Breaking cycles of grief and distance

### **Narrative and Memory**
- Danny's power is literally about stories—the thing Annette loved most
- Initially a source of pain: every trope pull reminds him of what he lost
- Gradually becomes solace: his power is a way to never forget her
- By using narrative devices to help people, he honors her memory
- The story continues even after the storyteller is gone

- Could be earlier save of Dinah due to his different perspective/involvement
- Or might not be involved at all depending on story focus

### **S9 Arrival**
(Potential future arc)
- Both Danny and Taylor would fight
- Different perspectives on same battles
- Jack Slash's analysis of both Heberts
- Family protecting each other becomes tactical advantage and liability

### **Banking Strategic Tropes**

- PRT uncertain of classification - Trump? Thinker? Something else?
- Some speculate "Redline" refers to pushing limits/maximum performance
- Gangs treat him warily - hard to predict, hard to counter

### **Power Interactions**

**Shard Politics:**
- Danny's shard is relatively happy with conflict generation
- Taylor's QA wants bigger, better conflicts
- Potential for shard communication/coordination
- Both shards benefit from their hosts' relationship

**Thinker Blindness:**
- Danny's power is random, hard to predict
- Tattletale gets fragments but not full picture
- Contessa's Path confused by trope randomness
- Coil's timelines complicated by variable tropes
- Dinah's precognition shows multiple confusing branches

**Power Synergies:**
- Danny's tropes + Taylor's bugs = creative combinations
- Tropes that enhance multitasking help Taylor control more bugs
- Tropes that improve precision help Taylor's coordination
- Combat tropes stack well with swarm tactics

## Story Tone and Style

### **Narrative Voice**
- Third person limited, primarily Danny's POV
- Some chapters from Taylor's POV for parallel storytelling
- Occasional interludes from other characters
- Relatively grounded despite reality-warping powers

### **Tone Balance**
- **Drama**: Father-daughter relationship, cape dangers, moral dilemmas
- **Action**: Cape fights, gang confrontations, Endbringer battle
- **Humor**: Absurdist trope applications, dramatic irony of secret identities
- **Heart**: Family bonds, community protection, finding connection
- **Tragedy**: Secrets hurting relationship, unintended consequences, costs of power

### **Pacing**
- Slower character development in Act I
- Rising action through Act II with increasing cape involvement
- Climactic Leviathan fight and revelations in Act III
- Resolution focuses on relationships rather than just action

### **Meta Elements**
- Light meta-commentary on cape genre tropes
- Danny occasionally recognizes trope patterns
- Not breaking fourth wall, but acknowledging genre conventions
- Balancing meta-awareness with emotional authenticity

## Writing Considerations

### **Avoiding Common Pitfalls**

**Overpowered Protagonist:**
- Power is random and situational
- Not all tropes are useful in all situations
- Banking mechanic limits spam
- Conflict-driven means running away weakens power
- Can't solve every problem with tropes

**Secret Identity Drama:**
- Don't drag it out too long (revelation by Chapter 21)
- Use dramatic irony for tension, not frustration
- Make both Danny and Taylor sympathetic in their secrecy
- Revelation feels earned, not cheap

**Character Consistency:**
- Danny remains fundamentally himself: protective, caring, sometimes ineffective
- Powers don't fix his emotional limitations
- Taylor remains Taylor: independent, strategic, prone to secrets
- Both grow but don't become different people

**Canon Respect:**
- Keep world consistent with Worm's tone and rules
- Other characters act according to their canon motivations
- Danny's presence changes things but doesn't break world
- Butterflies are logical consequences, not convenient

### **Unique Selling Points**

1. **Parent Protagonist**: Rare in Worm fanfic
2. **Dual Secret Identity**: Father and daughter both capes
3. **Working Class Hero**: Union organizer, not student or soldier
4. **Meta Power**: Trope application is unique mechanic
5. **Community Focus**: Protecting docks, not saving world
6. **Relationship Core**: Story is about family, not just action

### **Potential Expansions**

**If Story Continues Past Act III:**
- Danny and Taylor working together openly
- Handling S9 as family
- Coil plot with both involved
- Echidna creates clones of both
- Dealing with Cauldron
- Taylor's eventual path (different from canon Khepri?)
- Danny's role in larger conflicts

**Side Stories:**
- Kurt and Lacey's perspective
- Other dockworkers learning about Danny
- Armsmaster's investigation of Plot Twist
- Emma's perspective on Taylor's recovery
- Coil's attempts to recruit/control Danny

## Opening Scene (Draft)

*The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, that particular frequency that drilled into Danny's skull after enough hours. He'd been sitting in this plastic chair for seventy-two hours, with only brief breaks to use the bathroom or choke down food he didn't taste. His daughter lay in the hospital bed, her face pale, her body occasionally twitching with phantom distress.*

*The doctors said she was stable. They said she was healing from the infection. They said the psychological trauma would take time to process.*

*They didn't say anything about why Taylor still thrashed in her sleep, muttering about insects. About too many. About everywhere. About crawling.*

*Danny held her handÃ¢â‚¬â€carefully, gently, as if she might shatterÃ¢â‚¬â€and felt completely useless.*

*He'd failed her. He hadn't seen the bullying. Hadn't noticed her isolation. Hadn't protected her from whatever happened at that school. And now she was breaking in front of him and he couldn't help. Couldn't fix it. Couldn't even understand what was hurting her.*

*Annette would have known what to do. She'd sit right here and tell Taylor a story—something beautiful or funny or comforting, something to reach her daughter when nothing else could. But Annette was gone, and Danny had never learned that particular magic. All he could do was hold Taylor's hand and feel utterly, completely useless.*

*A nurse came in to check vitals, and Danny didn't look up. He just sat there, watching his daughter's face twist in distress, and felt something inside him break.*

*LaterÃ¢â‚¬â€he wouldn't remember how much laterÃ¢â‚¬â€he would realize that's when everything changed. When the helplessness became too much. When the need to help, to fix, to protect overwhelmed everything else.*

*When he triggered.*

*But in that moment, Danny Hebert just sat beside his daughter's bed, held her hand, and wished desperately that he could change the story they were living.*

## Power Mechanics Summary

### **Quick Reference**

**Each Trope Pull:**
- Roll 2d20
- Assign each die to Longevity OR Intensity
- Apply to target within seconds, or it defaults to Danny
- If no valid targets exist, trope fails to manifest (full refund)

**Natural 1:**
- Danny unaware trope was applied
- Triggers blind reroll for that characteristic
- He must assign the reroll without knowing what it affects

**Natural 20:**
- Trope is not pulled; instead Danny earns a Bonus Modifier
- Modifiers can affect any existing active trope
- 9 options: +3/-5 to dice, reroll dice, expire trope, swap dice values, make permanent, change target, +3 energy, refresh duration

**Trope Application Failure:**
- If no valid targets exist or trope doesn't fit situation, it fails to manifest
- Failed pulls refund the full charge cost
- 10-second recovery time before next pull
- Encourages experimental power use

**Charge System:**
- Maximum capacity: 5 charges
- Regeneration: 1 charge per day + 1 charge per battle
- Each trope pull costs 1 charge upfront
- Banking a trope locks 1 charge for up to 3 days
- Can bank up to 5 tropes, but each locks a charge slot

**Energy Refunds:**
- Failed pull (unusable trope): Full refund (0 net cost)
- Temporary pull expires: 0.5 charge refund (0.5 net cost)
- Banked pull dissipates after 3 days: 0.5 charge refund (0.5 net cost)

### **Longevity Reference**
- **2-7**: Seconds to minutes (tactical use)
- **8-12**: Minutes to hours (scene duration)
- **13-14**: Hours to days (episode length)
- **15-17**: Days to month (arc length)
- **18**: Permanent* (degrades over time/use)
- **19**: Permanent (true, never expires)

### **Intensity Reference**
- **1-5**: Barely noticeable to subtle
- **6-10**: Noticeable but not dramatic
- **11-15**: Clear and significant effect
- **16-19**: Extreme, reality-bending

## Notes for Development

- Consider whether to include PHO interludes showing public perception of new cape
- Decide on specific tropes for key story moments
- Map out which canon events happen and which butterfly away
- Determine Taylor's cape name and team affiliation in this timeline
- Consider if Emma/Sophia learn about cape identities
- Plan specific Danny/Taylor conversation scenes for emotional beats
- Decide on ultimate story endpoint: pre-Leviathan, post-Leviathan, or longer arc
